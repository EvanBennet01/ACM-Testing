# ACM-Testing

This repository is made up of 3 files based in C

- A classic rabbit and fox game
- A file that will induce an artificial delay for inputs of the program in order to test the ACM
- An Asynchronous Communication Mechanism. The role of an asynchronous communication mechanism (ACM) is to synchronize the transfer
of data in a system between a writing process and a reading process operating concurrently. This
allows the in and out to operate at different rates while maintaining synchronicity.
